Hi, everypony! This is **Annie K Rarity Sparklight**, a cute girl (physically and mentally) who loves coding!


What? My username? Oh, that's my former name. I'd like to change it, but thus can cause so so so so many troubles!  
(Just forget about it, ok?)

- Meet [Alicorn](https://github.com/Andy-K-Sparklight/Alicorn), she's my best friend!

I mostly speaks Equish (yeah that's Equestria English), but I can handle some Chinese as well (only when necessary).  

Also, you can always treat me like a little filly if you like~

My avatar comes from Rarity in *My Little Pony: Equestria Girls*, only because I like her grace! (And I want to be as generous as her!)

My name consists of 4 parts (that's weird, right?), *Annie* because I chose it. *K* stands for Kindness. *Rarity* is still that Rarity I mentioned above (you'll probably think that I must have lost my mind). *Sparklight* is not the original version of my family name, I just simply changed it.  
(AND PLEASE! DO NOT call me *Miss Sparklight*, I don't like that! *Annie* will be better.)
